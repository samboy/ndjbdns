This is a maintenance-only fork of N-DJBDNS.  The only things that
will be updated are:

* The list of root servers.
* Any security holes which are found in the future.  While I will consider
  all security reports, security holes without CVE numbers may very well
  be ignored or not patched.  
* Compile time errors in a LTS release of Ubuntu.

Other issues will not be fixed, e.g. compile-time warnings, issues in any
Linux distribution (or other *NIX clone) *besides* Ubuntu LTS, usability 
issues, etc.

My ability to support N-DJBDNS is very limited; I actually use (actually, I
*wrote*) MaraDNS, and I am only maintaining this branch of djbdns
because itâ€™s important to have a currently maintained version of this
DNS server, and no one else is stepping up to the plate to maintain it.
